                        <p class="font-prata">Certainly! The theory of relativity, proposed by Albert
                            Einstein,
                            revolutionized our
                            understanding of space, time, and gravity. It's composed of two parts: <strong>special
                                relativity</strong> and <strong>general relativity</strong>.</p>

                        <p class="font-prata "><strong>Special Relativity</strong> focuses on the physics of
                            objects in uniform motion and
                            introduces two fundamental ideas. Firstly, it posits that the laws of physics are the same
                            for
                            all non-accelerating observers. Secondly, it asserts that the speed of light in a vacuum is
                            constant, regardless of the speed at which an observer travels. This leads to phenomena such
                            as
                            time dilation (time slowing down for objects in motion) and length contraction (objects
                            appearing shorter in the direction of motion), both of which have been confirmed by
                            experimental
                            evidence.</p>

                        <p class="font-prata"><strong>General Relativity</strong>, on the other hand, extends
                            these principles to include
                            acceleration and gravity. Einstein proposed that gravity is not a force between masses, as
                            Newton had suggested, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Massive
                            objects like stars and planets curve the spacetime around them, and this curvature directs
                            the
                            motion of objects and light passing nearby. This theory has profoundly impacted cosmology
                            and
                            astrophysics, providing explanations for the orbits of planets, the bending of light around
                            massive objects (gravitational lensing), black holes, and the expansion of the universe
                            itself.
                        </p>

                        <p class="font-prata">The implications of relativity extend far beyond these examples.
                            They challenge our intuitive
                            understandings of time and space, influencing the development of technologies such as GPS
                            satellites, which must account for relativistic effects to provide accurate positioning.
                            Furthermore, general relativity has become a cornerstone of modern cosmology, underpinning
                            our
                            efforts to understand the universe's origins, structure, and ultimate fate.</p>

                        <p class="font-prata">Relativity remains one of the most successful physical theories,
                            accurately predicting natural
                            phenomena and withstanding rigorous testing over a century. Its blend of profound insights
                            and
                            experimental validation underscores the elegance and power of physics in deciphering the
                            cosmos's mysteries.</p>
